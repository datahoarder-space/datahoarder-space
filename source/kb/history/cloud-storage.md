# Cloud storage {#cloud-storage}

Cloud storage plays a key role for many data hoarders in being able to store all of their hoarded data, although the services we have used to store our data has changed drastically and gone from service to service over time.

## Amazon Drive (formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive) {#amazon-drive}

In March 2015, Amazon introduced unlimited cloud drive plans for non-business users. 

This soon caught the attention of many datahoarders, and based upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/5s7q04/i_hit_a_bit_of_a_milestone_today/">this reddit post where someone uploaded over a petabyte of webcam streams</a>, it can be presumed that amazon quickly caught on to the masses of storage that users began to use on their service at a very low monthly cost. 

Promptly after the over-a-petabyte upload and as more and more datahoarders uploaded masses of data to the platform, Amazon decided to pull the plug on the unlimited tier in June 2017. Users who had just transferred tens, hundreds or thousands of terabytes of data were now stuck as they either had to move the data promptly or change to Amazon's new (very steeply priced) plan at $50/terabyte/month.

## Google G Suite {#g-suite}

Google's G Suite service offering continues to this day to be the cloud storage of choice for many datahoarders, with it seemingly having no caps on its $10/user plan. 

We have even seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2F0wjoKEhg">Linus Media Group use it</a> to backup the 'Petabyte project', that is until they found the throttling limit around 150TB, but the proof-of-concept was there and proves it to be seemingly unlimited if you can get past the throttling.

## Microsoft Onedrive {#onedrive}

Microsoft's Onedrive has a lot of pricing structures dependent on whether you are a personal user, business user or Office 365 user. It seems to contend with G Suite with affordable storage plans such as 'unlimited' storage for Office 365's OneDrive for Business Plan 2 for £7.50/user/month or $10.00/user/month, and 6TB (1,000GB/user - 6 users) on Office 365 Home for £79.99/year or $99.99/year, which also includes the desktop version of Microsoft Office.

## Backblaze B2/AWS S3 {#b2}

Both Backblaze's B2 service and Amazon Web Service's S3 service are long term mass storage solutions that many use for long term backup of their important data or hoarded data. Backblaze continues to offer a much cheaper service than AWS.
